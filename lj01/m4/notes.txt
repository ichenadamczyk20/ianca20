Query Comparison Operators
  * MQL has update operators (e.g. $inc, $set, $unset) to modify data in the database.
  * Query operators provide additional ways to located data within the database.
      * These include: $eq, $neq, $gt, $lt, $gte, and $lte.
          * Ex: {"tripduration": {"$lte": 70}} finds trips with trip durations less than 70.
          * Ex: {"usertype": {"$ne": "Subscriber"}} finds users who aren't subscribers.
          * These different filters can be chained in an object for "db.collection.find" or the Atlas UI.
  * $ precedes MQL operators and aggregation pipeline states, and allows access to field values.

Lab 1 Comparison Operators solution: db.zips.find({"pop": {"$lt": 1000}}).count() -> 8065
Lab 2 Comparison Operators solution: db.trips.find({"birth year": {"$gt": 1998}}).count()
                  - db.trips.find({"birth year": {"$eq": 1998}}).count() -> 6

Logic Operators
  * $and, $or, $nor, $not are the logic operators, and they behave as, expected from experience in other languages.
  * $and, $or, and $nor need to be used in the form {<operator> : [{statement1},{statement2}, ...}, while $not can be
    used in the form {<operator>: {statement}}.
  * Implicit $and is used as the default operator when an operator is not specified. {field1: value1, field2: value2} is
    the same as {$and: [{field1: value1}, {field2: value2}]}. Explicit $and should be used when you need to include
    the same operator more than once in a query (e.g. {$and: [{$or: [..., ...]}, {$or: [..., ...]}}] ).

Quiz 1 solution: db.inspections.find({result: "Out of Business", sector: "Home Improvement Contractor - 100"}).count()
                    -> 4
Lab 1 Logic Operators solution: db.zips.find({"pop": {"$lte": 1000000, "$gte": 5000}}).count() -> 11193
Lab 2 Logic Operators solution: db.companies.find({"$and": [{"$or": [{"founded_year": 2004}, {"founded_month": 10}]},
                    {"$or": [{"category_code": "social"}, {"category_code": "web"}]}]}).count() -> 149

$expr
  * $expr, the expressive query operator, allows the use variables, conditional statements, and aggregation expressions
    within the query language.
  * $expr can compare two different fields in the same document. The dollar sign before the field name indicates that
    we are analyzing the value and not the field value across documents.
          Ex: {"$expr" : {"$and": [ { "$gt": ["$tripduration", 1200] },
                                    { "$eq": ["$start station id", "$end station id"]} ]}

Lab $expr solution: db.companies.find({"$expr": {"$eq": ["$permalink", "$twitter_username"]}}).count() -> 1299

Array Operators
  * $push allows us to add an element to an array, or turn a field into an array field from a previously different type.
  * Searching {"amenities": ["Internet"]} only finds documents with field-value pair {"amenities": ["Internet"]}.
  * Searching {"amenities": ["Internet", "Wifi", ...]} only finds documents with field "amenities" with that exact
    value, size, and order.
  * {"amenities": {"$size": 20, "$all": ["Internet", "Wifi"]} will find documents with a value for "amenities" that has
    an exact size of 20 and contain at least "Internet" and "Wifi", in no particular order.

Lab 1 Array Operators solution: db.listingsAndReviews.find({"reviews": {"$size": 50}, "accommodates": {"$gt": 6}})
                        -> {name: "Sunset Beach Lodge Retreat"}
Lab 2 Array Operators solution: db.listingsAndReviews.find({"amenities": {"$all": ["Changing table"]},
                                                            "property_type": "House"}).count() -> 11
