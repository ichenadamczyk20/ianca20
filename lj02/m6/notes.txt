Atlas Features
  * The data explorer has the "Indexes" tab, which lists the indexes of the collection, allowing you to delete indexes
    and view performance advice.
  * The "Schema Anti-Pattern" tab provides you with sound advice about your data model after enough queries have been
    used.
  * The "Aggregation" tab allows you to build aggregation pipelines and see how the data is transformed through each
    stage.
      * The query is entered in the left side of the UI, and the results are displayed on the right side. Each stage
        will have its own box that can be dragged around to reorder each stage.
      * For each stage, you select the operator and will be given a bit of documentation for the syntax.
      * When you are done, you can export the pipeline into code in your language of choice, to use in your application.
  * The "Search Indexes" tab is a more sophisticated indexing system (Atlas Search) that allows you to use advanced
    search functionality.

Atlas Products and Options
  * When you first started using atlas, you needed to create an organization, which allows you to manage billing across
    groups and teams. (If you are using a free cluster, you don't have to worry about billing.)
  * Within an organization, you have projects. Users are assigned to projects, a step made easier by grouping users into
    teams. All users in an organization can view all the projects of that organization.
  * Each project can have different clusters within it, as long as each of the cluster has a unique name.
  * Realm allows developers to build web or mobile applications using MongoDB without worrying about scaling servers
    but still being able to track the databases at a low level.
  * Charts allows you to create dynamic data visualizations and use them wherever you like.
      * Start by creating a dashboard, which can have many charts in it.
      * You can configure Charts to apply an aggregation pipeline to the data first, or to only visualize a sample.
      * Select a chart type and select the fields for each parameter to generate the chart.
      * You can view the aggregation pipeline that was used to create the chart.

MongoDB Compass (MongoDB's GUI Project)
  * A UI to connect to MongoDB databases.
  * You start by connecting to a cluster, either by entering a connection link or by filling out individual fields.
  * You then see all of the databases, including admin, config, and local, automatically created databases that you
    should never touch unless told to by support. You can also see the size and the number of indexes of the databases
    and a list of their collections with the number of documents, indexes, and their sizes.
  * You can view the data in normal field:value view, JSON view, or table view, making it easier to explore documents
    and sub-documents.
  * You can also enter a query (with options for projections and sorting), or create aggregation pipelines, like in
    the Atlas UI.
  * Creating indexes (indexes tab) and query performances (Explain Plan tab) is also pretty simple in MongoDB Compass.
      * After creating an index and running a query, you will get a visual tree and raw JSON about the performance
        of the query.
      * The difference of documents examined and the documents returned should be as low as possible to indicate
        optimal performance. If the difference is high, you may need a different index.
  * From the Validation tab, you can configure MongoDB to filter the data that is entered into the database and only
    accept valid data according to your rules.
  * The Schema tab will try to visualize your data in the most helpful way. If you have coordinates stored in a field,
    the Schema tab will recognize this and display that field on a map automatically.
