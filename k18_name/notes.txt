 - We used "display: flex" on the body element to change the order that the elements are displayed. We want the
   main foo heading and the nav heading to appear next to each other, but since they are not next to each other
   in the HTML, we used "order: n" to change the order they were displayed, with lower values of n pushing
   the element to the left, and higher values of n pushing the element to the right.

 - While there is a :first-line selector for CSS, there is no :last-line selector for CSS. From our research
   on stackoverflow, it seems the only way to modify the last line of a paragraph element is to use
   "text-align-last".

 - In order to add a styled copyright text, the last br is given a pseudo-element, ::after. It is positioned
   vertically by using the parent br's height (since the br is in the content flow) and horizontally by using
   "position: absolute" with respect to the body element. It has a positive z-index, so it covers the already
   existing "Copyright" text. This is impossible to replicate with inline css however, since pseudo-elements
   cannot be selected inline. We agreed that it is impossible to achieve any such affect with only inline CSS,
   since not being able to select pseudo-elements, and options like "text-align-last" being insufficient, there
   is no way to change only the last line of the paragraph element, unless the last line is given its own HTML
   element with its own inline CSS. Therefore, we added spins to contain the copyright text as it is in the HTML.
