LJ00 -- Le Voyage de Learnination avec Mongo, Premi√®re Phase (Chapters 1 and 2)

  * MongoDB is a NoSQL (it doesn't store in related data tables) document database.
  * Documents are a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs ({<field> : <value>}).
  * A collection is an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields.

  * Atlas is a database as a service, using MongoDB at its core.
  * Clusters are a group of servers that store your data.
  * An instance is a single machine running a certain software, locally or in the cloud.
  * A replica set are a few connected MongoDB instances that store the same data. (If something bad happens to an instance,
    other instances will have data as backups.)
  * Services manage cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment, use the cloud service of your choice, and
    allow you to experiment with different tools and features.

Lab: Deploying the new cluster took about five minutes. I had to click on the logical size graph
     to see the logical size increase to ~350 MB as it should be, while in the thumbnail, it said the logical size was
     around 200MB.

  * We will interact with our clusters and data through the Data Explorer (from the Collections button) and
    through the shell (from the Connect button).

(Installing mongodb was a bit messy since I had to update xcode but I had to free up some disk space to do that...)
  * To connect to a mongodb server, use a command of the form:
    mongo "mongodb+srv://sandbox.u4lgh.mongodb.net/<dbname>" --username m001-student
