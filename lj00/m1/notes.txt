MongoDB is a NoSQL (it doesn't store in related data tables) document database.
Documents are a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs ({<field> : <value>}).
A collection is an organized store of documents in MongoDB, usually with common fields.

Atlas is a database as a service, using MongoDB at its core.
Clusters are a group of servers that store your data.
An instance is a single machine running a certain software, locally or in the cloud.
A replica set are a few connected MongoDB instances that store the same data. (If something bad happens to an instance,
    other instances will have data as backups.)
Services manage cluster creation, run and maintain database deployment, use the cloud service of your choice, and
    allow you to experiment with different tools and features.

Did the lab... deploying the new cluster took about five minutes. I had to click on the logical size graph
    to see the logical size increase to ~350 MB as it should be, while in the thumbnail, it said the logical size was
    around 200MB.

We will interact with our clusters and data through the Data Explorer (from the Collections button) and
    through the shell (from the Connect button).

(Installing mongodb was a bit messy since I had to update xcode but I had to free up some disk space to do that...)
Command to connect to a mongodb server:
